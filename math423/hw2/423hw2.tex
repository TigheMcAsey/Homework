        It suffices to show that \(\spec(A)\) satisfies the finite intersection property (FIP) for closed sets, since if given any collection of closed sets \(\set{V_i}_{i \in I}\) we have
        \begin{align*}
            \bigcap_{i \in I}V_i = \emptyset \implies \exists V_{i_1},\hdots,V_{i_N}, \text{ such that } \bigcap_{j=1}^N V_{i_j} = \emptyset
        \end{align*}
        Then given any collection \(\set{U_i}_{i \in I}\) of open sets we have
        \begin{align*}
            \bigcup_{i \in I}U_i = \spec(A) &\iff \bigcap_{i \in I}U_i^c = \emptyset \implies \exists U_{i_1}^c,\hdots,U_{i_N}^c, \text{ such that } \bigcap_{j=1}^N U_{i_j}^c = \emptyset \\
            &\iff \left(\bigcup_{j=1}^N U_{i_j}\right)^c = \emptyset \iff \bigcup_{j=1}^N U_{i_j} = \spec(A)
        \end{align*}
        
        Now let \(\set{V_i}_{i \in I}\) be a collection of closed sets, such that \(\bigcap_{i \in I}V_i = \emptyset\), then by the characterization of Zariski closed sets, \(V_i = V(S_i)\), for some \(S_i \subset A\), and \(\emptyset = \bigcap_{i \in I}V_i = V(\bigcup_{i \in I}S_i)\). This suffices to show that \(\gen{\bigcup_{i \in I}S_i} = A\), since if \(\gen{\bigcup_{i \in I}S_i}\) were a proper ideal of \(A\), then there would exist some maximal ideal \(\mathfrak{m} \supset \gen{\bigcup_{i \in I}S_i}\), and since maximal ideals are prime we would have \(\mathfrak{m} \in V(\bigcup_{i \in I} S_i)\) which is impossible since it is empty. Since \(\gen{\bigcup_{i \in I}S_i} = A\), there exist \(\set{s_k}_{k=1}^n \subset \bigcup_{i \in I}S_i \tand \set{a_k}_{k=1}^n \subset A\), such that \(\sum_{k=1}^n a_ks_k = 1\), each \(s_k\) lies in some \(S_{i_k}\) which implies that \(\gen{\bigcup_{k=1}^N S_{i_k}} = A\), in particular
        \begin{align*}
            \emptyset = V(A) = V\left(\bigcup_{k=1}^N S_{i_k}\right) = \bigcap_{k=1}^N V_{i_k}
        \end{align*}
        This suffices to show that \(\spec(A)\) satisfies the FIP and is hence quasi-compact. \qed

        First suppose that \(\nil(A)\) is prime, and let \(V(S_1), V(S_2)\) be Zariski closed sets, such that \(V(S_1) \cup V(S_2) = \spec(A)\), then since \(\nil(A)\) is prime it must be contained in one of the two closed sets, without loss of generality assume that \(\nil(A) \subset V(S_1)\), then
        \begin{align*}
            S_1 \subset \nil(A) = \bigcap_{\substack{P \subset A \\ P \text{ is a prime Ideal}}} P
        \end{align*}
        Implying that \(P \in V(S_1)\) for all prime ideals \(P \subset A\), but this is equivalent to \(V(S_1) = \spec(A)\), since \(V(S_1),V(S_2)\) were arbitrary this suffices to show that \(\spec(A)\) is irreducible.

        I will prove the converse using the contrapositive. Assume that \(\nil(A)\) is not prime, then there are \(x,y \in A\), such that \(x,y \not \in \text{Nil}(A)\), and \(xy \in \nil(A)\). It follows that
        \begin{align*}
            V((x))\cup V((y)) = V((xy)) \supset V(\nil(A)) = \spec(A)
        \end{align*}
        where \(V(\nil(A)) = \spec(A)\) is proven in the previous part of the problem. So it will suffice to show that \(V((x)), V((y)) \subsetneq \spec(A)\) to conclude that \(\spec(A)\) is irreducible. Since \[x,y \not \in \nil(A) = \bigcap_{\substack{P \subset A \\ P \text{ is a prime Ideal}}} P\]
        there are prime ideals \(x \not \in P_x, y \not \in P_y\), so that \(P_x \not \in V((x)), P_y \not \in V((y))\) hence neither can be all of \(\spec(A)\). \qed

        \textbf{Lemma.} \emph{\(M\) is finitely generated implies M satisfies the aescending chain condition (ACC)}. Assume that \(M = \gen{x_1,\hdots,x_n}\), then for any chain of submodules, \((N_i)_I\) we have \(\bigcup_I N_i = M\) implies that \(N_j = M\) for some \(j \in I\) (and hence all \(i \geq j\)).

        \textbf{Proof of Lemma.}

        \textbf{(a)} 
        
        Let \(M \neq 0\) be a finitely generated \(A\)-module.

        \textbf{(b)} Suppose for contradiction that \(N \subsetneq \mathbb{Q}\) is maximal, then by the correspondance theorem \(\mathbb{Q}/N\) has no proper submodules. Hence for any \(0 \neq x \in \mathbb{Q}/N\) (there is always such an \(x\) since \(N\) is a proper submodule), it must be the case that \(\gen{x} = \mathbb{Q}/N\), since \(\mathbb{Q}/N\) is generated by a single element as a \(\mathbb{Z}\) module, it must be a homomorphic image of \(\mathbb{Z}\), furthermore since it is generated by any of its elements as a \(\mathbb{Z}\) module, it must be a finite cyclic group- in other words \(\mathbb{Q}/N \cong \mathbb{Z}/(p)\) for some prime \(p\). Hence by the first isomorphism theorem, we have a surjective \(\mathbb{Z}\) module homomorphism \(\varphi: \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Z}/(p)\), with \(\ker \varphi = N\). I claim that \(\varphi\) is the zero map, contradicting that it is surjective, as proof, let \(x \in \mathbb{Q}\), then \(\frac{x}{p} \in \mathbb{Q}\), then \[0 + (p) = p\varphi(\frac{x}{p}) + (p) = \varphi(p\frac{x}{p}) + (p) = \varphi(x) + (p)\]
        Since \(x\) was arbitrary this shows that \(\varphi(x) = 0\) for all \(x \in \mathbb{Q}\)
